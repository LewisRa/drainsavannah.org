          Introduction
        %p
          The Adopt a Drain Durham program enables Durham residents to "adopt"
          one of the city's storm drains or catch basins and pledge to keep it
          free of leaves, dirt, litter, and other debris. The program helps reduce 
          localized flooding and fosters community engagement by encouraging the
          public to take an active role in improving their neighborhood.

          Partners
        %p
          Code for Durham and other volunteers used a web-based platform called
          Github to develop the open source web application on Ruby on Rails.
          Github enabled contributors to work on the project from anywhere
          in the world. They modeled Adopt a Drain Durham on Boston's Adopt
          a Hydrant, for which Code for America provided initial development 
          support in 2012.
